  ## Installation
  #### Open the code in VS Code. Enter the terminal and enter SQL by typing 'mysql -u root -p' and enter the SQL password. Run 'source db/schema.sql' and type '\q' to exit. Type 'node seeds/index.js', then 'npm i', then 'npm start' to run the application in Insomnia. The following packages will be running in your application: 'mysql2', 'sequelize', and 'express'.

  #
  ## Usage
  #### I used the [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) and [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) packages to connect your Express.js API to a MySQL database and the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package to use environment variables to store sensitive data.
